# Genre playbook — `technical-deep-dive`

```yaml
id: technical-deep-dive
name: Technical deep dive
mandate: >
  Make a competent skeptic believe the mechanism is real, that you have run it
  or could, and that you know what it costs. Not to impress them — to be
  argued with on the merits.
default_lane: table          # dense, read-primary, appendix legal, objection loop expected
```

## Audience

```yaml
audience:
  assumed_knowledge: >
    They know the domain's primitives cold and will be insulted by an
    explanation of them. State the level explicitly and hold it; the whole
    genre's economy comes from what you are allowed to skip.
  what_they_distrust:
    - mechanism claimed but not shown
    - a design with no stated cost ("what does this make worse?")
    - anything that reads as never having been run against reality
    - benchmark/comparison axes chosen because you win on them
    - novelty claims — they will mentally map every part to prior art, and if
      you have not done that mapping out loud they will assume you cannot
  decision_they_hold: >
    Usually NOT approval. They hold a credibility judgment — is this worth
    engaging with — and, downstream, whether they will adopt or recommend.
    Staging an approval-ask at them is a category error.
  attention_budget: >
    High for mechanism, near-zero for preamble. They will read the artifact
    later, alone, more carefully than they listen to it now.
```

## Selection

```yaml
pick_when:
  - the audience can evaluate the mechanism and will
  - the artifact's value IS the mechanism and its tradeoffs
  - the material has a genuine cost/limit that can be stated honestly
  - the artifact will be forwarded to people who were not in the room
skip_when:
  - the audience cannot evaluate the mechanism → executive-explainer
  - one specific decision is being requested today → internal-decision
  - the goal is for them to be able to DO it afterwards → teach-workshop
  - the room is large, one-way and projected → conference-keynote
  - there is no honest cost to state (there always is; if you cannot find it,
    you do not understand the design well enough to present it)
instead_use:
  executive-explainer: audience holds budget/strategy, not implementation
  teach-workshop: success is measured by capability, not belief
  internal-decision: a named person must choose today
```

## Arc — 7 beats

```yaml
arc:
  - beat: ground
    intent: state the shared substrate and the level of abstraction, once
    minutes_share: 0.08
  - beat: rupture
    intent: the specific failure that actually happened, named and dated
    minutes_share: 0.11
  - beat: diagnosis
    intent: the root is structural, not disciplinary — this is the pivot
    minutes_share: 0.08
  - beat: mechanism
    intent: how it works, in the order it works; the largest block
    minutes_share: 0.33
  - beat: proof
    intent: the moment the mechanism is seen doing the thing
    minutes_share: 0.08
  - beat: cost
    intent: what this makes worse, what stays unsolved, what is still open
    minutes_share: 0.17
  - beat: standing
    intent: how it gets built and adopted; what you want from them
    minutes_share: 0.15
```

Beat notes:

- **`ground` is one slot.** Two is an early sag. The temptation to
  re-establish context for the least-expert reader is how this genre dies at
  the front.
- **`rupture` must be a named event, not a category.** "Review state is
  mutable" is a property. "This verdict was erased by that approval on that
  date" is a rupture. The genre lives or dies on this substitution.
- **`diagnosis` carries the artifact's one `pivot`.** It is the sentence that
  converts a list of incidents into one bug.
- **`mechanism` is the largest block and runs in mechanism order.** Nothing
  may be inserted into it.
- **`cost` is mandatory and non-negotiable in this genre.** See
  `anti_patterns`. Its absence is the strongest negative signal available to
  this audience and they read it instantly.

## Slot sequence

```yaml
slide_sequence:
  - {slot: 1,  function: cover,      beat: ground,     required: true}
  - {slot: 2,  function: statement,  beat: ground,     required: true}   # the arguable thesis
  - {slot: 3,  function: fact,       beat: rupture,    required: true}   # the named incident
  - {slot: 4,  function: claim,      beat: diagnosis,  required: true}   # the pivot claim
  - {slot: 5,  function: mechanism,  beat: mechanism,  required: true}
  - {slot: 6,  function: mechanism,  beat: mechanism,  required: true}
  - {slot: 7,  function: mechanism,  beat: mechanism,  required: false}
  - {slot: 8,  function: mechanism,  beat: mechanism,  required: false}
  - {slot: 9,  function: comparison, beat: mechanism,  required: true}   # old model vs new, on THEIR axes
  - {slot: 10, function: statement,  beat: proof,      required: true}   # ← the bold moment sits here
  - {slot: 11, function: objection,  beat: cost,       required: true}   # the killer objection first
  - {slot: 12, function: objection,  beat: cost,       required: true}   # the cost/limit, stated as theirs
  - {slot: 13, function: mechanism,  beat: standing,   required: true}   # how it gets adopted
  - {slot: 14, function: evidence,   beat: standing,   required: false}  # prior art / build-vs-reuse
  - {slot: 15, function: ask,        beat: standing,   required: true}
  - {slot: 16, function: end,        beat: standing,   required: true}
  - {slot: A1, function: appendix,   beat: null,       required: false}  # table lane only
```

Sequencing constraints specific to this genre:

- Slots 5–8 are **one unit**. No fact, quote or section may be inserted.
- Slot 9 must be a single slot. A comparison split across two slots is not a
  comparison.
- Slot 11 carries the objection that would kill the argument, not the easiest
  one. The easy objections go in the appendix or nowhere.

## Bold moment

```yaml
bold_moment:
  beat: proof
  form: >
    Something the mechanism DOES, shown happening — a refusal, a transcript,
    a live failure, an artifact the audience can check. Not a strong sentence,
    not a striking number: an event.
  why: >
    This audience converts "described" into "believed" only on contact with an
    instance. The bold moment is the instance. It is also the only place in
    the genre where a rehearsed dramatic beat is not read as salesmanship —
    because what is dramatic is the machine's behaviour, not the presenter's.
  placement: >
    AFTER the mechanism block, never before it. The bold moment must be
    something the audience can now evaluate, and they can only evaluate it
    once they hold the mechanism. Placing it at the front — as an opening hook
    — spends the strongest asset on an audience not yet equipped to be
    impressed by it, and leaves the mechanism block with nothing to build
    toward. That ordering rule is the part that matters and it is medium-
    independent; the PERCENTAGE is not.
  placement_deck: >
    55-70% of the way through the SLOT SEQUENCE, by index. Slot 10 of 16 = 63%.
  placement_video: >
    72-85% BY TIME, and this figure is DERIVED, not chosen. The deck's 55-70%
    is arithmetically unsatisfiable in this lane and shipping it here trained
    people to ignore the gate:

      runtime_shares put `rupture+diagnosis` at 0.35 and `mechanism` at 0.40,
      so the `proof` beat cannot BEGIN before 0.35 + 0.40 = 75% of runtime.
      No staging of this lane can place its bold moment inside 55-70%.
      proof's own share is 0.10, so the beat runs 75% → 85%; allowing one
      scene of overlap where a lane pulls the proof slightly forward gives
      the stated 72-85%.

    THE GENERAL RULE, which is what to carry to any other lane: a bold
    moment's placement window is the span of the beat that carries it,
    computed from THAT LANE'S OWN runtime_shares. Cumulative share before the
    beat = the window's open; cumulative share through it = the window's
    close. Show the arithmetic in the artifact. A percentage inherited from
    the other medium is a rule that cannot be obeyed.
    Consequence to stage for: a bold moment at 75% leaves ~25% of runtime
    after the peak. A slack tail after a late peak is how this shape fails —
    cut the cost and ask beats to the bone and end on the cut.
  count: 1
```

## Time shape

```yaml
time_shape:
  deck:
    minutes: {min: 6, ideal: 9, max: 15}
    seconds_per_slot_floor: 30      # table lane: dense slots need dwell
    slides: {min: 10, ideal: 16, max: 22}   # excluding appendix
    presented_vs_read: read-primary
    minutes_per_beat_at_9min:
      ground: 0.75
      rupture: 1.0
      diagnosis: 0.75
      mechanism: 3.0
      proof: 0.75
      cost: 1.5
      standing: 1.25
    arithmetic: >
      9 min × 60 = 540s ÷ 14 content slots = ~38s/slot, above the 30s floor.
      At 20 slots the same 9 minutes gives 27s/slot — below floor. Cut slots.
    appendix: excluded from the arithmetic; it is read, never walked
  video:
    minutes: {min: 3, ideal: 5, max: 6}
    hard_ceiling_reason: >
      Engagement falls off sharply past roughly six minutes; a longer piece is
      several pieces. Segment rather than extend.
    cold_open: 20-40s, before any title
    runtime_shares: {rupture+diagnosis: 0.35, mechanism: 0.40, proof: 0.10, cost: 0.10, ask: 0.05}
    word_budget: 130-150 wpm — staging is zero-sum; adding a beat deletes a beat
    devices:
      - misconception first: surface the wrong model the viewer probably holds,
        let it be uncomfortable, THEN correct it. A clean exposition delivered
        to someone holding a wrong model underperforms saying nothing.
      - progressive reveal in narration order — nothing on screen before the
        voice reaches it
      - the cost beat is the trust tell; commercial video omits it and viewers
        of this genre notice
      - end on the cut. No summary, no "in conclusion", no fade.
    cover_becomes: >
      There is no `cover` slot in a film. It dissolves into a cold open
      (20-40s, before any title) plus a title that lands at scene 2 or 3.
      Both video lanes needed this and neither playbook used to say it.
    beats_with_no_share: >
      `ground` and `standing` get NO bucket in runtime_shares. That is not an
      oversight — it is the lane's largest single edit, and it fires the kill
      condition "the material needs 40 minutes and the slot is 10" with its
      own instruction attached: cut BEATS, not depth. Route the adoption path
      and the build-vs-reuse map to a companion document and have the ask
      point at it.
    motion_governor:                    # STANDARD FIELD SET — references/motion-roles.md
      status: required in this lane
      fields_per_scene: [motion_role, energy, peak, motion_turn, figures]
      role_vocabulary: the closed eight in references/motion-roles.md
      rules: R1 earned · R2 paid-for · R3 ceiling-ordering · R4 rhyme-to-answer ·
             R5 quiet-more-than-half · R6 ornament gate
      peaks_for_this_genre: >
        3-4. The mechanism block is `assemble` throughout and its scenes are
        busy by mandate — but busy is not a peak. Reserve the peaks for the
        rupture, the proof, and at most one mechanism scene whose content is a
        RELATIONSHIP rather than a part (the thing a narrated sentence conveys
        worst).
      proof_beat_is_arrest_not_rupture: >
        The proof beat shows the mechanism REFUSING something. `arrest` — a
        motion begun and refused mid-gesture — is the role, and its amplitude
        is deliberately capped below the rupture it answers (R3, R4). A
        refusal that is loud is a boast, and this audience is watching for
        exactly that. The piece demonstrates its central property by NOT
        completing a movement.
      cost_beat_is_divest: >
        `divest` on the volunteered-cost scenes: motion is subtractive only.
        The visible downshift is itself the register signal that the piece has
        stopped selling.
      ornament_budget: >
        2 figures per scene; the bold moment may spend 3. This genre fails
        this gate more than any other: a mechanism scene attracts one diagram
        per clause, and the clauses that are already legible in the narration
        buy nothing. Every figure names its clause or it is cut at STAGE.
```

## Opening and closing moves

```yaml
opening_move:
  name: cold thesis
  do: >
    Slot 2 is one arguable sentence, stated flat, with no warm-up and no
    agenda. Then immediately the named incident.
  avoids: >
    The preamble failure — credentials, agenda, roadmap, "a bit of background
    first". This audience's attention is highest in the first ninety seconds
    and lowest during orientation; an agenda slide spends the best moment on
    the least content. It also avoids the opposite failure, the mystery open,
    which reads as a magic trick to people whose job is to distrust magic.

closing_move:
  name: hand over the open questions
  do: >
    End by naming what is unresolved and asking them to resolve it — the
    specific open items, by number, with what a good answer would look like.
  avoids: >
    The finished-artifact failure: a summary close implies the design is done,
    which converts a potential critic into a passive reader. It also avoids
    ending on Q&A, which discards the last high-attention moment, and ending
    on a thank-you slide, which discards it twice.
```

## Transitions

```yaml
transitions:
  - {after_beat: ground,    type: escalate, note: "from the shared substrate to what broke on it"}
  - {after_beat: rupture,   type: turn,     note: "the artifact's single pivot: not discipline, structure"}
  - {after_beat: diagnosis, type: narrow,   note: "from the diagnosis into the first mechanism"}
  - {after_beat: mechanism, type: fold,     note: "the parts become one property — sets up the bold moment"}
  - {after_beat: proof,     type: escalate, note: "now the cost, in their terms, before they raise it"}
  - {after_beat: cost,      type: narrow,   note: "from limits to the concrete adoption path"}
  - {after_beat: standing,  type: gate,     note: "the one boundary where the artifact asks"}
```

## Kill conditions

```yaml
kill_conditions:
  - condition: no honest cost can be stated
    do: stop; you are staging advocacy. Go back to the material.
  - condition: the mechanism cannot be shown doing anything
    do: >
      There is no bold moment available. Either find the instance, or accept
      this is a design memo and ship a document instead of a deck.
  - condition: the audience cannot evaluate the mechanism
    do: re-CLASSIFY as executive-explainer
  - condition: a specific decision is required from a named person today
    do: re-CLASSIFY as internal-decision
  - condition: the material needs 40 minutes and the slot is 10
    do: >
      Cut BEATS, not depth. Fewer beats at full depth survives; all beats at
      one-third depth is the shape people leave without.
```

## Anti-patterns

```yaml
anti_patterns:
  - symptom: the deck reads as a tour of the document's table of contents
    cause: >
      The arc was inherited from the source material's section order instead
      of built from the audience's objection order.
    fix: >
      Rebuild the middle from the objection list (see audience.md rule 1).
      Section order is authoring order; objection order is reading order.
  - symptom: everything is impressive and nothing is doubted
    cause: only supporting evidence was selected
    fix: >
      Give the killer objection its own slot BEFORE the ask, in the
      audience's own words. The artifact gets shorter and more credible.
  - symptom: the audience agrees but does not engage afterwards
    cause: closed on summary; no open questions handed over
    fix: apply closing_move; name the unresolved items by number
  - symptom: the middle sags around the mechanism block
    cause: mechanism slots in authoring order, not in mechanism order
    fix: re-sequence so each slot is the next thing that actually happens
  - symptom: the strongest asset (a demo, a transcript, a refusal) opened the deck
    cause: bold moment placed as a hook
    fix: >
      Move it to the proof beat. Keep the named incident at the front as
      EVIDENCE — evidence and bold moment are different jobs and the front
      slot wants the former.
  - symptom: the deck is unreadable without the presenter, and it got forwarded
    cause: staged presented-primary; the genre is read-primary
    fix: headline claims become complete sentences; detail moves to appendix
```

## Gates

```yaml
gates:
  - id: helicopter
    check: the headline claims alone, in order, form the complete argument
  - id: mechanism-order
    check: mechanism slots run in the order the mechanism runs, uninterrupted
  - id: bold-after-mechanism
    check: >
      bold moment index > last mechanism slot index — the ordering rule, and
      it binds in both media. DECK: 55-70% by index. VIDEO: 72-85% BY TIME,
      derived from this lane's runtime_shares; show the arithmetic. Applying
      the deck figure in the video lane is a FAILURE OF THE GATE, not of the
      draft, and it is why placement_video exists.
  - id: motion-budget          # VIDEO lane only
    check: >
