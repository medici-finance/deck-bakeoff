# Genre stubs — the five not yet written out

These five carry `id`, `mandate` and `pick_when` only. **A stub is not usable
for staging.** If CLASSIFY routes here, write the full playbook first — the
field list is in SKILL.md's HANDOFF schema and the two complete playbooks
(`technical-deep-dive.md`, `executive-explainer.md`) are the shape to follow:
audience block, pick/skip/instead, 5–9 beat arc, slot sequence with functions
and no visual field, bold moment with a placement rule, deck **and** video
time shapes, opening/closing moves each naming the failure they avoid,
transitions per boundary, kill conditions, anti-patterns, gates.

Writing one is roughly half a day and should be triggered by a real artifact,
not by a desire for a complete set. Playbooks written speculatively encode
nobody's actual audience.

```yaml
- id: investor-pitch
  mandate: >
    Make a funder believe this team can take this market at this moment — and
    give them the one number they will repeat to their partners.
  pick_when:
    - capital is the ask, from people whose job is allocating it
    - the audience will see fifty of these this month
    - the decision is a partnership meeting you will not be in
  known_open_question: >
    The conditional ordering branch — founder-led decks put the team early,
    product-led decks put it late — is the one real structural fork in this
    genre and the playbook must state the selection rule, not offer a menu.

- id: board-update
  mandate: >
    Let a governing body exercise oversight without reading the appendix —
    surface what changed, what is off-plan, and what needs them.
  pick_when:
    - a standing body meets on a cadence and holds fiduciary duty
    - most of the content is unchanged since last time
    - the real content is exceptions, not status
  known_open_question: >
    This genre's hardest rule is what to LEAVE OUT of the walk while keeping
    it in the pack. It is the strongest test of the appendix discipline.

- id: sales-proposal
  mandate: >
    Move a buying group — not a buyer — from interest to a specific next
    commitment, with the objections of the absent members pre-answered.
  pick_when:
    - a purchase is being progressed and several people must agree
    - the artifact will be forwarded to people who never meet you
    - a competitor is in the room whether or not they are named

- id: internal-decision
  mandate: >
    Get one specific decision made, by a named person, in this meeting.
  pick_when:
    - the decision-maker is present and holds the authority
    - the options are enumerable and the recommendation is real
    - not deciding has a stated cost
  known_open_question: >
    Recommendation-first or options-first is audience-dependent, not a house
    default: some decision-makers want the answer immediately, others read a
    recommendation-first deck as having been denied the alternatives. The
    playbook must make this a stated fork with a selection rule.

- id: conference-keynote
  mandate: >
    Leave a room of strangers holding one idea they will repeat to someone who
    was not there.
  pick_when:
    - large room, one-way, projected, hall lane by construction
    - the audience chose to be there and owes you nothing
    - success is propagation, not agreement
  known_open_question: >
    The only genre where the artifact legitimately does NOT stand alone
    without its narrator — which inverts the read-fallback rule that governs
    every other playbook here. That inversion needs stating explicitly, or
    the house default will quietly ruin the genre.

- id: teach-workshop
  mandate: >
    Leave people able to do something they could not do before — measured by
    doing, not by agreeing.
  pick_when:
    - success is capability, and can be tested in the room
    - the audience will practise, not just listen
    - the material has a correct order of operations that must be respected
  known_open_question: >
    The only genre whose time shape is dominated by what the AUDIENCE does,
    not by what is presented. Its slot sequence needs an exercise function
    that the other six do not have — which is a real test of whether the
    closed vocabulary in slide-functions.md is the right size.
